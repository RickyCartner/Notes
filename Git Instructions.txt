Examples of git add
git add usually fits into the workflow in the following steps:

1) Create a branch: git branch update-readme
2) Checkout to that branch: git checkout update-readme
3) Change a file or files
4) Save the file or files
5) Add the files or segments of code that should be included in the next commit: git add README.md
6) Commit the changes: git commit -m "update the README to include links to contributing guide"
7) Push the changes to the remote branch: git push -u origin update-readme


But, git add could also be used like:

1) Create a branch: git branch update-readme
2) Checkout to that branch: git checkout update-readme
3) Change a file or files
4) Save the file or files
5) Add only one file, or one part of the changed file: git add README.md
6) Commit the first set of changes: git commit -m "update the README to include links to contributing guide"
7) Add another file, or another part of the changed file: git add CONTRIBUTING.md
8) Commit the second set of changes: git commit -m "create the contributing guide"
9) (Repeat as necessary)
10) Push the changes to the remote branch: git push -u origin update-readme
